# Movies Extract Transform Load
## Purpose
Amazing Prime, the World's largest online retailer sponsored a hackathon asking participants to predict popular movies.  Their goal was to determine which low budget movies being released would become popular so they could buy the streaming rights at a bargain.  Brita is creating data sets for the hackathon and has the following information:
* Wikipedia Movies released from 1990
* ratings data from movielens a site run by the GroupLens research team which has over 20 million moving ratings

In order to make information available for the hackathon Brita needs to extract the movie data, transform it, and load it into a SQL database for access by the participants.
